The main purpose of this diploma thesis was to develop, program and implement a spare part
warehouse for the “MEWA Textil-Service GmbH”. For a long time, spare parts had to be
searched for tediously and without the help of any guides or support. The new visualization
should make it easier for employees to find a desired spare part.
If an employee scans the requested spare part by means of a scanning device, or by entering
name or item number into the displayed search bar, a list containing all desired pieces
appears. With the help of a filter it is possible to divide these parts again, in order to provide a
more precise search. By double-clicking on the spare part you are looking for, the building
view opens. The building in which the selected part is located is framed in red. Another
mouse click displays the room view of the respective building, also framed in red. After man
or woman has insured oneself in which room the spare part is, the shelf view is opened by
further clicking. If the employee now clicks on the highlighted shelf, a picture of the
compartments appears, with the relevant compartment where the spare part is located lighting
up. In this compartment the items inside are shown and the desired spare part is thus visible.
After the employee is aware of the position of the desired spare part, a further mouse click on
the displayed path can be used to reset to the starting point or to previous steps of the
visualization.
Please note that a setup via the admin screen is necessary before using the visualization for
the first time. To get access to the admin window, click on the button “Admin-Login". The
Admin serves as the editing interface. If new rooms are added, shelves or compartments
purchased, these can be easily adapted in the visualization. By pressing the labeled buttons
and using a drop-down menu it is possible to edit all properties such as arrangement, size,
name and position of rooms, shelves and compartments as desired.
